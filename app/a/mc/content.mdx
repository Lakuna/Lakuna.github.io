# Minecraft server

My Minecraft server runs 24/7 at *mc.lakuna.pw*.

The server uses [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) with [JellySquid](https://jellysquid.me/)'s performance mods
(Lithium and Phosphor) and [Stardust Labs](https://www.stardustlabs.net/)' world generation data packs (Terralith,
Nullscape, Incendium, and Structory). It is hosted by [Revivenode](https://revivenode.com/).

The world has been pre-generated using [Chunky](https://modrinth.com/plugin/chunky), and a [squaremap](https://modrinth.com/plugin/squaremap)
is available [here](https://map.mc.lakuna.pw/).

The server will usually be running the latest version of Minecraft, but you can check the server's status
[here](https://mcsrvstat.us/server/mc.lakuna.pw) to make sure.

The screenshot above was taken with [Complementary Shaders](https://www.complementary.dev/) and
[Faithful 32x](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/faithful-32x) on Minecraft 1.19.2.

Although it is possible to connect to the server with a vanilla client, I recommend using Fabric with JellySquid's
performance mods (Lithium, Phosphor, and Sodium). If you use shaders, [Iris](https://irisshaders.net/) is a great
alternative to OptiFine that works with Sodium.
