# Story Rating System

Below is a description of the metrics I use for rating [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43584115-travis-martin),
[movies](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur153160737), and [anime](https://anilist.co/user/Lakuna0/). I prefer to use a ten-point
scale, but this framework can easily be extended to any scale.

## 10/10 (Masterpiece)

This tier is reserved for my absolute favorite story in a given medium. In general, they are emotionally impactful, thought-provoking,
and, most importantly, entertaining. Any problems that are present in the story don't detract from the entertainment value.

I use stories in this tier as a metric for rating other stories.

# 9/10 (Fantastic)

Stories that I would recommend to everyone go in this tier. In general, these stories tend to be emotional, hilarious, and/or awesome, and
they must appeal to a very wide variety of people.

# 8/10 (Great)

Stories that I would recommend to most people go in this tier. Stories in this tier and above are my go-to recommendations.

# 7/10 (Good)

Stories that I would recommend to some people go in this tier. Stories that are good or even great but only appeal to a small niche would
likely find themselves here.

# 6/10 (Fine)

Stories that I would watch or read again but wouldn't generally recommend to people go in this tier.

# 5/10 (Average)

Stories that I would watch or read sequels of but wouldn't re-consume or recommend to people go in this tier.

# 4/10 (Bad)

Stories that I wouldn't watch sequels of go in this tier. In general, stories that require you to "turn your brain off" to enjoy belong here.

# 3/10 (Very bad)

Stories that are not entertaining go in this tier.

# 2/10 (Horrible)

Stories that I would be embarrassed or ashamed to admit that I've consumed for any reason belong in this tier.

# 1/10 (Appalling)

This tier is reserved for the worst of the worst. If I find it upsetting that a story even exists at all, it belongs in this tier.
