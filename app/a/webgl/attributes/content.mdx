# Attributes

You may need to read the previous article about [WebGL](/a/webgl/what-is) in order to understand this one.

Since WebGL runs on the GPU, data must be passed to the GPU in order to be used for rendering. One way to pass data to
the GPU is with *attributes*.

Attributes are a type of variable in a WebGL program that are used as inputs to vertex shaders. Based on rules
specified by the developer, each time the vertex shader is executed, each attribute will read a certain amount of data
from the buffer assigned to it. As such, attributes are used to supply vertex-specific data to the shader program.

```glsl
#version 300 es

/*
Attributes are inputs to vertex shaders. The naming
convention for attributes is camelCase prefixed by "a_".
*/
in vec4 a_position;

void main() {
	gl_Position = a_position;
}
```

Once an attribute has been declared in a shader program, it can be accessed with the WebGL API by getting its
*location*. μGL does this step automatically when linking shader programs.

```js
const positionAttributeLocation = gl.getAttribLocation(
	program, "a_position");
```

## Buffers

Attributes can only read data from arrays of binary data called *buffers*.

A buffer can be created with the WebGL API.

```js
const positionBuffer = gl.createBuffer();
```

In order to access a buffer with the WebGL API, that buffer must be bound to a *binding point*. Different binding
points are used for different things.

```js
// The ARRAY_BUFFER binding point is used for most buffers.
gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, positionBuffer);

/*
Now, data can be put into the buffer by using ARRAY_BUFFER
instead of positionBuffer. The bufferData function puts
data into a buffer.
*/
gl.bufferData(
	// The buffer to put data into.
	gl.ARRAY_BUFFER,

	/*
	The data to put into the buffer. Since WebGL is
	strongly-typed, data must be supplied in the form of a
	TypedArray. This example will draw one two-dimensional
	triangle (2 dimensions per point times 3 points to draw
	1 triangle equals 6 values).
	*/
	new Float32Array([
		0, 0, // First point at (0, 0).
		0, 0.5, // Second point at (0, 0.5).
		0.7, 0 // Third point at (0.7, 0).
	]),

	/*
	The last argument is a hint to WebGL about how the data
	will be used. This is for optimization purposes
	internally. In this example, the data will never be
	changed, so STATIC_DRAW is the proper value.
	*/
	gl.STATIC_DRAW
);
```

With μGL, the following line of code is equivalent to the block above.

```js
const positionBuffer = new Buffer(gl,
	new Float32Array([0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0.7]));
```

## Vertex Array Objects

Since buffers contain binary data, WebGL needs some context in order to read data out of them. After all of the
necessary data has been put into buffers, a shader program can be told how to use those buffers through a
*vertex array object* (VAO). VAOs contain information like which buffer is supposed to be used for each attribute,
and what type of data is stored in each buffer.

Each VAO represents one "thing" that will be rasterized by a shader program. For example, imagine that you want to
draw two shapes: a cube and a sphere. A cube and a sphere are different shapes, so each one is made up of a different
set of vertices. Instead of writing two shader programs (one for each shape), you can instead make a VAO that uses
a buffer containing the positions to make a cube, and another VAO that uses a buffer containing the positions to
make a sphere.

```js
// Create a VAO.
const vao = gl.createVertexArray();

/*
Attributes must be enabled before they can accept data from
buffers.
*/
gl.enableVertexAttribArray(positionAttributeLocation);

/*
For each attribute, specify which buffer to use and how.
The buffer is automatically determined to be whichever
buffer is currently bound to ARRAY_BUFFER.
*/
gl.vertexAttribPointer(
	// The attribute to assign the buffer to.
	positionAttributeLocation,

	/*
	The number of components to pull from the buffer per
	iteration. Since this example put 2D data into the
	buffer, it pulls 2D data out of the buffer.
	*/
	2,

	/*
	The type of data in the buffer. Since this example put
	floating-point data into the buffer (by using a
	Float32Array), it pulls floating-point data out of the
	buffer.
	*/
	gl.FLOAT,

	/*
	Whether to normalize data after pulling it out of the
	buffer. The functionality of this option changes
	depending on the type of data in the buffer. Check the
	documentation for details.
	*/
	false,

	/*
	The number of bytes to skip forward after each
	iteration. Setting this value to 0 causes WebGL to
	assume that the data is tightly-packed; that is, each
	value is adjacent to the next, and all values are used
	in order.
	*/
	0,

	// The offset in bytes of the first element.
	0
);
```

The VAO defined in the example above makes it so that `a_position` pulls tightly-packed non-normalized floating-point
data from `positionBuffer` in intervals of $2$. With μGL, the following line of code is equivalent to the block above.

```js
const vao = new VAO(program,
	[new AttributeState("a_position", positionBuffer, 2)]);
```

The "thing" defined by the data stored in the buffers can be drawn by executing the appropriate draw function with
the correct VAO active.

```js
// Use the program that is used to draw the "thing."
gl.useProgram(program);

// Bind the VAO of the "thing."
gl.bindVertexArray(vao);

/*
Execute the draw function. The proper draw function for the
VAO in this example is drawArrays since the VAO does not
have indices.
*/
gl.drawArrays(
	// The type of primitive to draw.
	gl.TRIANGLES,

	// The number of vertices to skip.
	0,

	/*
	The number of vertices to draw. 1 triangle times 3
	vertices per triangle equals 3 vertices.
	*/
	3
);
```

With μGL, the following line of code is equivalent to the block above.

```js
vao.draw();
```

## Indices

WebGL allows vertices to be reused by specifying *indices* in the *element array buffer*.

Imagine that you want to draw a square, which has four vertices. A square is not a type of primitive, so it must
be drawn using two triangles, which totals six vertices. However, since two pairs of those six vertices overlap,
they can be defined using only four vertices if they are given indices.

```js
const positionBuffer = gl.createBuffer();
gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, positionBuffer);
gl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, new Float32Array([
	0, 1, // Vertex 0 at (0, 1).
	0, 0, // Vertex 1 at (0, 0).
	1, 0, // Vertex 2 at (1, 0).
	1, 1 // Vertex 3 at (1, 1).
]), gl.STATIC_DRAW);

const vao = gl.createVertexArray();
gl.enableVertexAttribArray(positionAttributeLocation);
gl.vertexAttribPointer(positionAttributeLocation,
	2, gl.FLOAT, false, 0, 0);

// Create the index buffer.
const indexBuffer = gl.createBuffer();

// Index buffers are bound to ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER.
gl.bindBuffer(gl.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, indexBuffer);

/*
Whenever data is put into the index buffer, the indices are
automatically applied to the current VAO. There is no need
to assign the buffer to the VAO afterward. This is because
while ARRAY_BUFFER is a global binding point,
ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER is part of the current VAO.
*/
gl.bufferData(gl.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, new Uint8Array([
	0, 1, 2, // First triangle with vertices 0, 1, and 2.
	0, 2, 3 // Second triangle with vertices 0, 2, and 3.
]), gl.STATIC_DRAW);
```

In μGL, an extra argument can be passed to the `VAO` constructor to apply indices.

```js
const positionBuffer = new Buffer(gl,
	new Float32Array([0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]));

const indices = new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 3]);

const vao = new VAO(program,
	[new AttributeState("a_position", positionBuffer, 2)],
	indices);
```

When the VAO that is being drawn has indices, the correct draw function is `drawElements`.

```js
gl.drawElements(
	// The type of primitive to draw.
	gl.TRIANGLES,

	/*
	The number of indices to draw. 1 square times two
	triangles per square times 3 indices per triangle
	equals 6 indices.
	*/
	6,

	/*
	The type of data in the index buffer. Since this
	example put unsigned 8-bit integer data into the index
	buffer (by using a Uint8Array), it pulls unsigned 8-bit
	integer data out of the buffer.
	*/
	gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE,

	/*
	The number of bytes to skip at the beginning of the
	index buffer.
	*/
	0
);
```

Note that μGL automatically uses the correct draw function, so no changes are necessary when adding indices
to an μGL VAO.
