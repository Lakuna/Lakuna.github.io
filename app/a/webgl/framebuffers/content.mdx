# Framebuffers

You may need to read the previous article about [textures](/a/webgl/textures) in order to understand this one.

*Framebuffers* are collections of attachments. They are used for rendering to textures and *renderbuffers*.
Renderbuffers are similar to textures, but they support more formats and options and can't be directly used as
input to a shader.

A framebuffer can be created with the WebGL API.

```js
const fb = gl.createFramebuffer();
```

Like textures and buffers, framebuffers must be bound to a binding point in order to be accessed with other functions.
Framebuffers have three binding points.

- When a framebuffer is bound to `DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER`, any WebGL API functions that would modify the color and depth buffers
instead modify the framebuffer's attachments.
- When a framebuffer is bound to `READ_FRAMEBUFFER`, any WebGL API functions that would read from the color and depth buffers
instead read from the framebuffer's attachments.
- When a framebuffer is bound to `FRAMEBUFFER`, it is bound to both `DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER` and `READ_FRAMEBUFFER`.

Attachments can be added using the `framebufferTexture2D`, `framebufferRenderbuffer`, and `framebufferTextureLayer`
functions. **Every attachment to a framebuffer must have the same dimensions.**

```js
gl.bindFramebuffer(gl.FRAMEBUFFER, fb);

gl.framebufferTexture2D(
	// The binding point of the framebuffer.
	gl.FRAMEBUFFER,

	// The point of attachment to the framebuffer.
	gl.COLOR_ATTACHMENT0,

	// The binding point of the attached texture.
	gl.TEXTURE_2D,

	// The texture to attach.
	texture,

	// The level of the texture.
	0
);
```

With μGL, framebuffer binding points are not necessary.

```js
const renderTexture = new Texture2D({
	gl,
	width: 256,
	height: 256,
	minFilter: TextureFilter.LINEAR
});

const fb = new Framebuffer(gl);

fb.attach(renderTexture,
	FramebufferAttachmentPoint.COLOR_ATTACHMENT0);
```

## Render to texture

Instead of writing image data to the color buffer and depth data to the depth buffer, we can use a
framebuffer to write that data to textures and renderbuffers. In order to do so, a framebuffer must
be bound when the render function is called. With μGL, this can be accomplished with the `bind` method.

```js
fb.bind();
```

Using the example above, image data is written to `texture`, which is attached to `COLOR_ATTACHMENT0`.

import RenderToTexture from "./RenderToTexture";

<RenderToTexture style={{ width: "100%" }} />

In the example above, there is no depth attachment on the framebuffer. To write depth data to a
texture, attach a depth renderbuffer to the framebuffer.

```js
const depthRenderbuffer = new Renderbuffer(gl,
	RenderbufferFormat.DEPTH_COMPONENT24, 256, 256);

fb.attach(depthRenderbuffer,
	FramebufferAttachmentPoint.DEPTH_ATTACHMENT);
```

import DepthAttachment from "./DepthAttachment";

<DepthAttachment style={{ width: "100%" }} />
