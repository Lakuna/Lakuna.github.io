You may need to read the previous articles about [cubemaps](/a/webgl/cubemaps) and [framebuffers](/a/webgl/framebuffers)

## Shadow maps

The most common way to draw shadows is with *shadow maps*. Using a shadow map is similar to projecting a texture, but the texture
contains depth data from the point of view of a light (located at the tip of the frustum).
