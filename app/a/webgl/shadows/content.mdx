# Shadows

You may need to read the previous articles about [cubemaps](/a/webgl/cubemaps) and [framebuffers](/a/webgl/framebuffers)
in order to understand this one.

## Shadow maps

The most common way to draw shadows is with *shadow maps*. Using a shadow map is similar to projecting a texture, but the texture
contains depth data from the point of view of a light (located at the tip of the frustum). Fragments that have a lower depth value
than the data that is stored in the shadow map are behind something else, so they can be drawn as if they are shadowed.

The shadow map can be generated by rendering the scene from the point of view of the projector (light source) and saving the depth data
into a framebuffer.

import ShadowMapping from "./ShadowMapping";

<ShadowMapping style={{ width: "100%" }} />
