summary: An introduction to uniforms in WebGL.

# Uniforms

You may need to read the 
[introductory article](/articles/webgl-what-is) in order to
understand this one. The previous article is about
[attributes](/articles/webgl-attributes).

Another way to pass data to the GPU is with *uniforms*.

Uniforms are variables that are uniform for each vertex.
They can be defined in either the vertex shader or the
fragment shader.

```glsl
#version 300 es

precision highp float;

/*
The naming convention for uniforms is camelCase prefixed by
"u_".
*/
uniform vec4 u_color;

out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
	outColor = u_color;
}
```

Once a uniform has been declared in a shader program, it
can be accessed with the WebGL API by getting its location.
Umbra does this step automatically when linking shader
programs.

```js
const colorUniformLocation = gl.getUniformLocation(
	program, "u_color");
```

In order to set a uniform's value, the function that
matches that value's type must be called. For example,
setting a `vec4`-valued uniform looks like this:

```js
gl.uniform4fv(colorUniformLocation, [0, 0, 0, 1]);
```

Umbra automatically determines the correct setter
function, so the following line has the same effect:

```js
program.uniforms.get("u_color").value = [0, 0, 0, 1];
```

Setting uniforms should be done between binding a VAO and
drawing it:

```js
program.use();
vao.bind();

program.uniforms.get("u_color").value = [0, 0, 0, 1];
// More uniforms...

vao.draw();
```

The next article covers the typical
[program structure](/articles/webgl-program-structure) when
using the WebGL API.
