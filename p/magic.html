	<header><h1>Magic: The Gathering - Deckbuilding Compendium</h1></header>

	<h2 id="before">Before Building</h2>
	<p>When building a new Magic deck, before you even begin looking at cards, there are a few first steps you must complete.</p>
	<p>First, come up with a <b>mission statement</b> (goal). This step is very important, since a weak mission statement invariably leads to a weak deck. A good example of a mission statement is,</p>
	<h3>"I am a mono-red aggressive deck that wants to attack and win quickly."</h3>
	<p>After your mission statement, I recommend coming up with a <b>theme</b>. A good theme will complement your mission statement. A theme can be a creature type or any other set of cards which complement each other. For example, <b>Goblins</b> would work incredibly well with a mono-red aggressive deck since they are cheap red creatures.</p>
	<p>Many good decks have a <b>backup plan</b> in case the primary goal doesn't work out. Backup plans are similar to mission statements, but <b>it's very important to make sure that they don't conflict with the mission statement in any way</b>. To continue using the example above, a good backup plan could look like,</p>
	<h3>"If I don't manage to kill my opponent early with Goblins, I'll use burn spells to finish them off."</h3>

	<h2 id="archetypes">Archetypes</h2>
	<p>There are a few common deck archetypes which most decks conform to. The most common are listed below.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Burn</b>, in which the player uses a multitude of direct-damage spells to kill their opponents and their opponents' creatures.</li>
		<li><b>Aggressive ("aggro")</b>, in which the player attacks the enemy with many cheap creatures, with the goal of killing them before they can become powerful.</li>
		<li><b>Control</b>, in which the player focuses on surviving until the later turns to play powerful late-game spells.</li>
		<li><b>Midrange</b>, which combines elements of aggressive and control decks to be generally powerful at all points in the game.</li>
		<li><b>Combo</b>, which centers on a specific combo or a set of specific combos to kill their opponents. Combo decks are <b>very difficult</b> to build well.</li>
		<li><b>Silver Bullet</b>, which centers on a single, very powerful card to either win or deal with certain situations. Silver Bullet decks are <b>extremely difficult</b> to build well.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="composition">Composition</h2>
	<p>Even though Magic decks can technically contain any number of cards at or above 60, you should always limit your deck to <b>exactly 60 cards</b>. This increases your chances of getting the cards you need when you need them. Aside from this rule, things covered in this section are just basic guidelines and can vary depending on the deck.</p>
	<p>To go with the 60 card limit, it is generally best to use as many copies of a card as possible in your deck. This maximizes the chance that you get a specific card when you need it. An excellent guide on how many copies of a card you should use in your deck can be found in the <a href="#links">links</a> section.</p>
	<p>It is recommended that you start building your deck with <b>24 lands</b>, and modify that number as the deck takes shape. In general, cheaper decks tend to use less land (rarely under 22), while expensive decks tend to use more (rarely over 26). Try to spread the types of lands in your deck roughly evenly between the colors that you're using. If one color is used more in the early game than the others, skew the land mix in the favor of that color a little bit.</p>
	<p>Wizards of the Coast recommends including 24-25 lands, 17-22 creatures, and 13-18 other spells in an average deck. These are decent guidelines to follow for very generic decks, such as those that I would recommend a new player build.</p>
	<p>Every successful deck includes ways to mess up its opponents' plans. Counter spells, discard spells, creature removal spells, and hexproof or indestructible permanents are good ways of doing this. Also remember that your opponents will be trying to mess with your plans. It is very important to <b>keep in mind that your opponent also takes actions</b> when building a deck, so a "perfect game" will never happen. This is a large part of why making a successful combo deck is so difficult. While building a deck, try to think about all of the different types of threats that an opponent could throw at you (i.e. lots of small creatures or a counter on one of your biggest spells), and take them into consideration while building your deck.</p>
	<p><b>Do not use a bad card just because it fits your theme</b>. All cards in your deck must be independently powerful, and should also synergize well with all of the other cards in your deck. None of your cards should ever feel like a waste of a draw to get.</p>

	<h2 id="manaCurve">Mana Curve</h2>
	<p>The following mana curves have been built using data from a variety of sources, including recommendations by professional players, algorithms, and computer simulations.</p>
	<p>Regardless of how you build your curve, it should peak between 2 and 4 cost, and go down from there in both directions. Most spells in the deck should cost between 2 and 4 mana.</p>
	<p>Spells should be plotted on the mana curve on the turn they <b>will</b> be played, not the turn where they <b>can</b> be played. A one-drop aura cannot go at 1 on the mana curve because auras must be applied to a creature, so they cannot be played on turn one.</p>
	<p>Don't use a more expensive version of a card, or an expensive card that's worse than a cheaper one, just to fit your curve. If a cheaper card is just better, there's no reason not to use it.</p>
	<div class="overflow">
		<table>
			<caption>Example mana curves</caption>
			<tr>	<th>Cost</th>	<th>Cheap</th>				<th>Midrange</th>			<th>Expensive</th>			<th>Perfect (draw)</th>	<th>Perfect (play)</th>	</tr>
			<tr>	<th>1</th>		<td>8-12</td>				<td>0-4</td>				<td>0-4</td>				<td>8</td>				<td>9</td>				</tr>

			<tr>	<th>8+</th>		<!-- Cheap -->				<!-- Midrange -->			<td>0</td>					<!-- Perfect (draw) -->	<!-- Perfect (play) -->	</tr>
		</table>
	</div>

	<h2 id="legality">Legality</h2>
	<p>In order for a deck to be legal to play, it must:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Contain <b>no less than</b> 60 cards.</li>
		<li>Contain <b>no more than</b> 4 copies of any non-basic cards<span title="Except when otherwise noted by the card.">*</span>.</li>
		<li>Contain no cards which are illegal in its intended format. A list of banned and restricted cards for each format can be found on the official Wizards of the Coast website.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
	<p><b>Every time you make a change to your deck</b>, ensure that:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Every card is individually powerful, consistent, and efficient.</li>
		<li>The deck meets the legality requirements.</li>
		<li>The mana curve still fits the deck.</li>
		<li>The deck's win conditions are obvious when looking through the deck.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Additionally, think about each deck archetype and think about how well your deck matches up against it. If you don't like your chances, revise your deck.</p>

	<h2 id="terms">Terms</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Spells</b> are every card that is used by the player aside from lands. This does <b>include creatures</b>.</li>
		<li><b>Permanents</b> are cards that stay on the battlefield after being cast. Most commonly, this refers to creatures, artifacts, and enchantments.</li>
		<li>The <b>Mana Curve</b> refers to the costs of spells in a deck. It is called this because, when plotted on a graph, the mana costs of all the spells in a deck should roughly resemble a bell curve.</li>
		<li>A card is <b>consistent</b> if it consistently has an effect on the game, regardless of common counters.</li>
		<li>A card is <b>efficient</b> if it provides a good payoff for its cost. It is important to remember that <b>even spells with no mana cost always cost one spot in your deck.</b></li>
		<li>A <b>mana sink</b> is any way that you can use excess mana on your turns if you don't have any spells to cast with it.</li>
		<li>A <b>basic card</b> is a card which has the supertype "Basic", such as Swamp and Island.</li>
	</ul>
