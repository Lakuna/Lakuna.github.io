			<h1>Adventure</h1>
			<a class='buttonlink' href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/860hicq9l45bi62/ADVENTUR.7z?dl=0'>Download</a>
			<p>Colossal Cave Adventure (A.K.A. "ADVENT," "Colossal Cave," or "Adventure") was developed between 1975 and 1977 by Will Crowther in FORTRAN for the PDP-10 mainframe, and expanded in 1977 by Don Woods. This version was ported to DOS in 1990 by Kevin Black.</p>
			<p>Adventure is the first known work of interactive fiction, the first text adventure game, and the precursor for the adventure game genre.</p>
			<p>Xyzzy is the magic word.</p>

			<p>Credit for this package goes to Tom Hunter, Paul Koning, Nat Kannan, and Gerard van der Grinten.</p>
			<p>This package contains an emulator for CYBIS, running on top of NOS (an operating system), running on a DtCYBER (version 5.5.1) emulation of a CDC CYBER mainframe. Also included are usage guides for PLATO, CYBIS, and the TUTOR programming language, and a copy of Pterm version 5.0.8. All contents are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
			<p>PLATO (<b>P</b>rogrammed <b>L</b>ogic for <b>A</b>utomatic <b>T</b>eaching <b>O</b>perations) was the first generalized computer-assisted instruction system. Starting in 1960, it ran on the University of Illinois' ILLIAC I. By the late 1970s, PLATO supported several thousand graphics terminals worldwide. Pterm (<b>P</b>LATO <b>term</b>inal emulator) is an emulator for one of those graphics terminals, and is required to connect to the system. Many modern concepts were originally developed on PLATO, including forums, message boards, email, chat rooms, instant messaging, remote screen sharing, and multiplayer video games.</p>
			<p>ILLIAC I was the first of the ILLIAC (<b>ILLI</b>nois <b>A</b>utomatic <b>C</b>omputer) series of computers built in 1952 by the University of Illinois. ILLIAC I was the first computer built and owned entirely by a United States educational institution.</p>
			<p>PLATO was developed at CERL (<b>C</b>omputer-based <b>E</b>duction <b>R</b>esearch <b>L</b>aboratory) at the University of Illinois. In 1976, CDC (<b>C</b>ontrol <b>D</b>ata <b>C</b>orporation) purchased the commercial rights to PLATO. The rights to the name were sold, and the product was rebranded to CYBIS (<b>CY</b>ber-<b>B</b>ased <b>I</b>nstructional <b>S</b>ystem).</p>
			<p>Eventually, University Online (later VCampus) acquired CYBIS from CDC. The contents of this package became available after VCampus went out of business and its assets were transferred to its former CEO Nat Kannan.</p>
			<p>TUTOR (A.K.A. "PLATO Author Language"), is a programming language developed for use on the PLATO system at the University of Illinois. TUTOR was initially designed by Paul Tenczar. Programs written in TUTOR are called "lessons," since the language was designed for computer assisted/managed instruction.</p>
			<p>It is highly recommended that you use Pterm to connect to either <a href='https://cyber1.org'>Cyber1</a> or <a href='https://irata.online'>IRATA.ONLINE</a> instead of your own emulation, so that you have access to the old lessons.</p>

			<h1>Dungeons of the Necromancer's Domain</h1>
			<a class='buttonlink' href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/d4cobuwasmzjqra/DND.7z?dl=0'>Download</a>
			<p>dnd (A.K.A. "The Game of Dungeons") was one of the first role-playing video games. The name is derived from the abbreviation "D&D" of the tabletop game Dungeons & Dragons, which released in 1974. dnd was developed by Gary Whisenhunt and Ray Wood in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO system in 1974 and 1975, and released in 1975. For more information about TUTOR and PLATO, see <a href='?tab=CYBIS'>the CYBIS tab</a>. Dirk Pellett and Flint Pellett made substantial enhancements to the game from 1976 to 1985.</p>
			<p>dnd was the first interactive game to feature what would later be referred to as "bosses."</p>
			<p>In 1977, Daniel Lawrence rewrote dnd in BASIC (<b>B</b>eginners' <b>A</b>ll-purpose <b>S</b>ymbolic <b>I</b>nstruction <b>C</b>ode) for the PDP-10 as DND. In 1982, he reworked and re-released the game as Telengard. In 1983, DEC (<b>D</b>igital <b>E</b>quipment <b>C</b>orporation, A.K.A. "Digital") rewrote DND in Pascal. Due to the availability of the BASIC source code, DND was later ported and adapted to newer systems and programming languages.</p>
			<p>In 1984, Bill Knight published DND for DOS. In 1988, he retitled and re-released it as Dungeons of the Necromancer's Domain (which is the download available here).</p>
			<p>dnd is the second-earliest surviving role-playing video game, behind only pedit5 (A.K.A. "The Dungeon"). pedit5 is believed to have been preceeded only by a game called "m199h," but no copies of that game survive. Some accounts claim that pedit5 may have actually preceeded m199h. dnd was directly inspired by pedit5, and most other early RPGs were directly inspired by dnd.</p>

		<div id='Doom'>
			<h1>Doom</h1>
			<a class='buttonlink' href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ni656s5nutx4zj/DOOM.7z?dl=0'>Download</a>
			<p>Doom was designed by John Romero, Tom Hall, and Sandy Petersen, and developed by id Software in 1993 for MS-DOS.</p>
			<p>Doom helped to define the FPS genre, and pioneered such technologies as 3D graphics, networked multiplayer, and modding.</p>
			<p>In 1997, id Software released the game's source code. This, along with the 2.39 megabyte file size of the original game, led to enthusiasts porting the game to a variety of devices - many of which were never designed for gaming (such as an ATM). Hence the phrase, "it runs Doom."</p>

					<p>Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty (A.K.A. "Dune II: (The) Battle for Arrakis," or "Dune II") was developed by Westwood Studios and published by Virgin Interactive in 1992. It is based on David Lynch's movie of the same name, which is an adaptation of Frank Herbert's novel of the same name.</p>
					<p>Although it wasn't the first RTS game, Dune II was the primary defining game for the RTS genre.</p>

			<p>Space Invaders was created as an arcade game in 1978 by Tomohiro Nishikado. It was manufactured and sold by Taito. This version was ported to MS-DOS by Paul S. Reid in 1995.</p>
			<p>Space Invaders was the first fixed shooter, and defined the shoot 'em up genre.</p>

			<a class='buttonlink' href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/wvxt8x8ww6cgwre/OUBLITTE.7z?dl=0'>Download</a>
			<p>pedit5 is the earliest surviving RPG (preceeded only by the now-lost "m119h"). dnd was directly inspired by pedit5, and is the second-earliest surviving RPG. For more context on the early history of this game, see <a href='?tab=DND'>the DND tab</a>. In 1975, Kevet Duncombe and Jim Battin developed Moria for the PLATO system. Moria was directly inspired by dnd - the developers claim not to have read J.R.R. Tolkien's works or known about Dungeons & Dragons when they began working on the game. Moria allowed players to play in groups of up to ten, and featured dynamically-generated dungeons and a wireframe first-person display. Oubliette was directly inspired by Moria.</p>
			<p>Oubliette was developed by Jim Schwaiger, John Gaby, Bencherd DeLong, and Jerry Bucksath, and published on the PLATO system in 1977. For more information about PLATO, see <a href='?tab=CYBIS'>the CYBIS tab</a>. It was known for being so difficult that it was impossible to play alone.</p>
			<p>This version was ported to DOS in 1983 by Bear Systems.</p>

			<p>This version was ported to DOS by Epyx in 1984.</p>
			<p>Rogue was the defining game for the Roguelike genre (hence the name - literally "like Rogue").</p>

			<h1>Spacewar!</h1>
			<a class='buttonlink' href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/3nv5xtn8tmcfy22/SPACEWAR.7z?dl=0'>Download</a>
			<p>Spacewar! was developed by Steve Russell (later Martin Graetz, Wayne Wiitanen, Bob Saunders, and Steve Piner) in 1962 for the PDP-1 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It was later spread to several installations of the PDP-1 computer, making it the first video game to be played at multiple computers.</p>
			<p>Spacewar! directly inspired the first two commercial arcade video games, Galaxy Game (1971) and Computer Space (1971), as well as Orbitwar (PLATO, 1974) and Asteroids (1979).</p>
			<p>Spacewar! was the first game on the game canon at the Library of Congress.</p>
			<p>The first-ever video game tournament was the "Intergalactic Spacewar! Olympics," held on October 19, 1972 and hosted by Rolling Stone.</p>
			<p>This version was ported to DOS by Bill Seiler in 1985, and is very faithful to the original.</p>
