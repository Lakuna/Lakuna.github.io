	<h1>Item Rework Impact Survey (IRIS)</h1>
	<p style='text-align: center;'>For League of Legends preseason 11.</p>
	<hr/>

	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>IRIS is my attempt at gathering <b>intentionally subjective</b> information regarding the community's perception of the League of Legends item system. The goal of the survey is to provide information which can be used to gauge <b>how people feel</b> about the item rework - something which would not be possible purely through the objective data offered on statistics websites.</p>
	<p>Before viewing the data, keep in mind that it is flawed in several ways; some of these ways are intentional, but others are side-effects.</p>
	<p>Intentional flaws:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The survey primarily takes into account the opinions of players who are very invested in a couple of champions. This is intentional, because these players are most likely to have a strong opinion on how to optimally play a champion.</li>
		<li>The survey was only visible to players who are likely to be very vocal about their opinions, since they are at least somewhat active in a third-party online community relating to the game. This is useful because it undoubtedly helped the form recieve as many answers as it did.</li>
		<li>Answers represent popular champions significantly more than unpopular champions. This is desirable because the goal of the survey is to measure the current meta.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Unintentional flaws:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The accuracy of the data received for each champion and class is highly dependent on how active their communities are.</li>
		<li>The community involvement is gated by the moderators of each subreddit, in the case that they remove my post.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Part One (9/14/20 - 9/21/20)</h2>
	<p>With the upcoming season 11 item rework just around the corner, now is the last time it will ever be possible to get an accurate view of the community's opinions on the old item system. As such, in order to ensure that we will be able to accurately measure the impact of the item rework in the future, I am starting this project to measure the community opinion in a (hopefully) comprehensive way.</p>
	<p>The Google Form where information is being collected can be found <a href='https://forms.gle/Gwaio5wPRzcij23S6'>here</a>.</p>
	<p>Update (9/21/20): One of the original posts can be found on my profile <a href='https://www.reddit.com/user/T3Lacuna/comments/isx7fa/item_rework_impact_survey/'>here</a>.</p>

	<h2>Part One Results (9/21/20)</h2>
	<p>After one week, the first part of the survey has been closed. Thank you so much to everybody who participated in the survey! Aside from a very small handful of spam complaints (sorry!) and one 30-day ban from r/Tahmkenchmains, the feedback was quite overwhelmingly positive. Below are some standout results, answers to questions submitted through the form, and the CSV and JSON files for anybody who wants the full data set.</p>
	<p><b>The data found here is not the data that this survey was intended to gather</b>. In order to get the final results, I need to take one more survey at the beginning of next season. This information is here because I have the data and it's interesting.</p>
	<h3>Data</h3>
	<p>The data is available in several ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href='https://forms.gle/Gwaio5wPRzcij23S6'>The old Google Form</a> has charts with generic overview information.</li>
		<li><a href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/wesp3n98xr84i7u/IRIS.7z?dl=0'>The CSV file</a> contains all answer information, completely unmodified. This file can be easily imported as a spreadsheet on Google Sheets.</li>
		<li><a href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/wesp3n98xr84i7u/IRIS.7z?dl=0'>The JSON files</a> contain cleaned-up information. iris.json is a cleaned version of the CSV file. champions.json, roles.json, items.json, and classes.json contain information by champion, role, item, and class, respectively.</li>
	</ul>
