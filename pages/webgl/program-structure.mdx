# Program Structure

You may need to read the 
[introductory article](/webgl/what-is) in order to
understand this one. The previous article is about
[uniforms](/webgl/uniforms).

Most of the WebGL API is dedicated to setting up state for
the shader program. A typical program that uses the WebGL
API follows this structure:

- *Initialization step* (run once at the beginning of the
program).
	- Get the rendering context.
	- Create all of the shaders and link them into shader
	programs.
	- Look up the locations of every variable in every
	shader program.
	- Create buffers and upload vertex data to them.
	- Create a vertex array object (VAO) for each "thing"
	that needs to be rasterized.
		- For each attribute that will accept data from a
		buffer:
			- Turn on the attribute.
			- Assign a buffer to the attribute.
			- Tell WebGL how to get data out of that
			buffer.
	- Create textures and upload data to them.
- *Render step* (run once each frame).
	- Clear the viewport.
	- Resize the viewport.
	- Set global state.
	- For each "thing" that needs to be rasterized:
		- Activate the shader program that is used to
		rasterize it.
		- Bind the VAO that represents it.
		- Set uniforms to the correct values for it.
			- Assign textures to texture units.
		- Execute the shader program.

The next article walks through a minimal
["Hello, world!"](/webgl/hello-world) WebGL API
program.
