# What is WebGL?

*WebGL* is a *rasterization engine*.
That means that it draws *primitives* (points, lines, and triangles) using pixels.
That is all that it can do.
Using WebGL to draw complex scenes is up to the developer.

WebGL is based on *OpenGL ES*.

## Shaders

WebGL runs on the GPU, so developers need to provide it code that can run on the GPU.
That code is supplied in the form of pairs of functions called *shaders*.
Each pair of shaders contains one *vertex shader* and one *fragment shader*.
Collectively, the pair of shaders is called a *shader program*.

Shaders are written in a strictly-typed C-like language called *GLSL*.

Each shader fulfills a different function:

- The vertex shader is run once for each vertex in the shape you're drawing; it computes the position of that vertex and outputs it as a *clip-space coordinate*.
Clip-space coordinates are a coordinate system that goes from `-1` to `+1` in every direction, regardless of the size of the viewport.
- Once the vertex shader has been run the proper number of times for the type of primitive being drawn (such as 3 for triangles), WebGL *rasterizes* (draws with pixels) that primitive.
The fragment shader is run once for each *fragment* (pixel) in the primitive being rasterized; it computes the color of that fragment.

The fragments from the fragment shader constitute a bitmap image stored in a *color buffer*, which is then displayed on a canvas.

## The WebGL API

The [WebGL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) is how developers interact with WebGL through JavaScript.
It can be accessed through the rendering context on an HTML canvas element.
