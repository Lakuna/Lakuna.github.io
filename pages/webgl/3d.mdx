# 3D

Working with three dimensions in WebGL is almost the same as working with two dimensions.

## Orthographic 3D

An *orthographic* projection is way to draw 3D without regard to perspective.
The example below uses only topics that have been covered before, but with 3D position inputs instead of 2D.

<CodePen slugHash="oNqvKRG" className={styles["full-bleed"]} />

Notice that the back of the rotating shape shows through to the front.
One way to address this issue is to draw only front-facing triangles.
By default, a triangle is front-facing if its vertices go in a counter-clockwise direction (relative to the camera).

```js
gl.enable(gl.CULL_FACE);
```

<CodePen slugHash="zYWYryq" className={styles["full-bleed"]} />

Now that clockwise triangles are being culled, many of the triangles aren't displaying.
This is because they're passed to the buffer in the wrong order.
By fixing the data in the position buffer, all of the triangles can be made to display.

Even with only front-facing triangles rendering, some triangles show up when they're behind others.
The solution to this issue is the *depth buffer*.
The depth buffer is used to remember the depth of a given pixel, so that WebGL can draw behind or in front of other pixels based on their distance from the camera.
The third ($z$) component of `gl_Position` is put into the depth buffer.
The depth buffer needs to be enabled before it can be modified:

```js
gl.enable(gl.DEPTH_TEST);
```

Just like the color buffer, the depth buffer needs to be cleared before drawing every frame.
With the WebGL API, this can be accomplished like this:

```js
gl.clearColor(0, 0, 0, 0);
gl.clearDepth(1);
gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | gl.DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
```

With Umbra, the third parameter of `clearContext` can be used to clear the depth buffer:

```js
clearContext(gl, new Color(0x000000), 1);
```
