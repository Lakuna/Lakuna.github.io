# Varyings

You may need to read the previous article about
[attributes](/webgl/uniforms) in order to understand
this one.

The final way to pass data to the GPU is with *varyings*.

Varyings are variables that vary between each vertex. They
are outputs from vertex shaders and inputs to fragment
shaders.

```glsl
#version 300 es

in vec4 a_color;

/*
Varyings are outputs from vertex shaders. The naming
convention for varyings is camelCase prefixed by "v_".
*/
out vec4 v_color;

void main() {
	v_color = a_color;
	gl_Position = vec4(0, 0, 0, 0);
}
```

```glsl
#version 300 es

precision highp float;

// Varyings are inputs to fragment shaders.
in vec4 v_color;

out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
	outColor = v_color;
}
```

Once WebGL starts to rasterize a primitive, the value of
the varying is interpolated between the values set on each
vertex of that primitive.
