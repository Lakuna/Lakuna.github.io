# Scene graph

A *scene graph* is a general data structure which arranges the logical representation of a graphical scene.
It is a collection of nodes in a tree structure, with each node having a parent and a non-negative number of children.

Each node's transformation matrix is multiplied by all of its ancestors' to generate its *world matrix*, which represents its actual position in the scene (relative to the origin).
