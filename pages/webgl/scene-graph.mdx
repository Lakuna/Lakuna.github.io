# Scene graph

You may need to read the previous article about
[transformation](/webgl/transformation) in order to
understand this one.

A *scene graph* is a general data structure that arranges
the logical representation of a graphical scene. It is a
collection of nodes in a tree structure, with each node
having one parent and a non-negative number of children.
Only the top node has no parent.

Each node's transformation matrix is multiplied by all of
its ancestors' to generate its *world matrix*. A world
matrix represents an actual position in a scene relative to
the origin, whereas a transformation matrix represents a
position relative to a parent.
