# Attributes

Since WebGL runs on the GPU, we need a way to pass data to the GPU so that we can draw with it.
One of those ways is through *attributes*.

Attributes are a type of variable in a WebGL program which are used as inputs to the vertex shader.
Based on rules specified by the developer, each time the vertex shader is run, each attribute will read a certain amount of data from the buffer assigned to it.
As such, attributes are used to supply vertex-specific data to the shader program.

## Buffers

Attributes can only read data from arrays of binary data called *buffers*.
They differ from regular arrays only in that they store binary data.

## Vertex array objects

Since buffers contain binary data, WebGL needs some context in order to read data out of them.
After all of the necessary data has been put into buffers, a WebGL program can be told how to use those buffers through a *vertex array object* (*VAO*).
VAOs contain information like which buffer is supposed to be used for each attribute, and what type of data is stored in that buffer.

Each VAO represents one "thing" to be drawn by a shader program.
For example, imagine that you want to draw two shapes: one cube and one sphere.
A cube and a sphere are different shapes, so each one is made up of a different set of vertices.
In order to avoid writing multiple separate shader programs just to draw different shapes, we can instead make one VAO which uses a buffer containing the positions to make a cube, and another VAO which uses a buffer containing the positions to make a sphere.
