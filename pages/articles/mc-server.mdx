# Minecraft Server

My Minecraft server runs 24/7 at **mc.lakuna.pw**.

The server uses [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) with [JellySquid](https://jellysquid.me/)'s performance mods (Lithium and Phosphor) and
[Stardust Labs'](https://www.stardustlabs.net/) world generation data packs (Terralith, Continents, Nullscape, Incendium, Structory, and Continents).
It is possible to connect to the server with a vanilla client.

The screenshot above was taken with [Complementary Shaders](https://www.complementary.dev/) and [Alacrity](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/alacrity)
on Minecraft 1.19.2.

Although it is possible to connect with a vanilla client, I highly recommend using Fabric with JellySquid's performance mods (Lithium, Phosphor, and Sodium).
If you use shaders, [Iris](https://irisshaders.net/) is a great alternative to Optifine that works with Sodium.
