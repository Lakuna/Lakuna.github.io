# The Dungeon

_The Dungeon_, perhaps better known as `pedit5`, is the first computer role-playing game and the progenitor of the dungeon crawl genre. It was developed over a four to six week period in the Fall and Winter of 1975 by Reginald "Rusty" Rutherford III for the PLATO system.

The game takes place in a dungeon. The player character is a combination of a fighter, a mage, and a cleric. The goal of the game is to amass twenty thousand experience points and then safely exit the dungeon. Experience points can be earned by finding treasure and slaying monsters.

You can watch my speedrun below.

I ended with 21,250 experience and 19,270 gold, and received 9.32% of my experience from kills.

## Creating a Character

At the beginning of the game, you are given a random character with four attributes, each between 3 and 18:

- _Strength_ modifies the damage and accuracy of your attacks.
- _Intelligence_ modifies the damage and accuracy of your spells.
- _Constitution_ modifies your _hits_ (health). You gain between 1 and 8 health at each level (plus 1 at the first level), modified based on your constitution.
- _Dexterity_ decides who will strike first in combat.

Specific details about each attribute are in the game's manual.

It is possible to randomize stats again by pressing BACK and then LAB.

The most important thing to know is that values between 7 and 15 for strength and intelligence and between 7 and 14 for constitution are the "default" values and don't modify gameplay. When I was randomizing my characters, I looked for high dexterity (at least 12) and health (at least 6) and no other stats below 7.

## Leveling Up

As you gain experience points, your character gains the following bonuses:

- At 0 experience (**level one**), gain one mage spell slot.
- At 1,500 experience, gain one cleric spell slot.
- At 2,000 experience, reach **level two**.
- At 2,500 experience, gain one mage spell slot.
- At 3,000 experience, gain one cleric spell slot.
- At 4,000 experience, reach **level three**.
- At 5,000 experience, gain one mage spell slot and one advanced mage spell slot.
- At 6,000 experience, gain one advanced cleric spell slot.
- At 8,000 experience, reach **level four**.
- At 10,000 experience, gain one mage spell slot and one advanced mage spell slot.
- At 12,000 experience, gain one advanced cleric spell slot.
- At 16,000 experience, reach **level five**.

Rewards for experience points are not applied until you exit the dungeon, so it is a good idea to do so often. If you choose to create a temporary character at the beginning of the game, you can press BACK after leaving the dungeon to immediately re-enter with the same character.

## Treasure

The following treasure can be found in the dungeon:

- _Gold coins_ grant one experience point each.
- _Silver coins_ grant one-tenth of an experience point each.
- _Gems_ grant between 100 and 600 experience points each.
- _Jewelry pieces_ grant between 1,000 and 6,000 experience points each.
- A _magic sword +1_ grants 500 experience points and increases the damage of your attacks by one.
- A _magic sword +2_ grants 1,000 experience points and increases the damage of your attacks by two.

Although I wouldn't recommend it in general, for speedrunning, I never went back to the exit for the first time without finding a piece of jewelry (since any run that didn't find an early jewelry would be too slow anyway).

## Navigating the Dungeon

The dungeon is composed of rooms and corridors separated by doors. Some doors are hidden and only have a small chance of revealing themselves as you pass. Some rooms contain treasure, monsters, or both. The format of the maze is the same every time, but the locations of monsters and treasure are randomized for each character. Additionally, there is a chance that a monster will appear after each time that you make a certain number of moves - even in corridors and rooms that you have already explored. In order to pass through a door, you must break it down. It is possible to break down hidden doors that you cannot see.

The following map of the dungeon is a slightly modified version of [one created by Nathan Mahney](https://crpgadventures.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-dungeon-victory.html).

I have numbered the rooms and categorized them into the following routes:

1. Rooms 1-11.
2. Rooms 12-17.
3. Rooms 18-26.
4. Rooms 27-37.
5. Rooms 38-44.
6. Rooms 45-53.
7. Rooms 54-64.
8. Rooms 65-70.
9. Rooms 71-87.
10. Rooms 88-102.
11. Rooms 103-112.
12. Rooms 113-131.
13. Rooms 132-142.

The rooms are numbered in the order that I would recommend exploring them. It is unlikely that it would take you more than about 70 rooms of exploring to win the game. The routes are designed to make a loop where possible so that they can be exited safely. Additionally, several are designed such that it is easy to continue from one to another (in case you have no reason to return to the exit yet).

## Spells

The basic mage spells are:

- _Sleep_ (mage spell) is guaranteed to put any non-undead monster below level 4 to sleep, allowing you to kill it.
- _Charm_ (mage spell) has a chance to charm any human or goblin, allowing you to kill it.
- _Magic missile_ (mage spell) has a chance to deal damage to an monster, and deals double damage to undead monsters.

The advanced mage spells are:

- _Speed_ doubles the number of actions that you can make before monsters have a chance of appearing and guarantees that you strike first in combat. It wears off after some time.
- _Blastbolt_ deals damage to a monster, and deals double damage to undead monsters. It cannot miss, but it has a chance to deal only half of the regular damage. It uses up all of your remaining spell slots of every type.

The basic cleric spells are:

- _Cure wounds_ heals you.
- _Protection from evil_ reduces the chance of being struck by a monster. It wears off after some time.
- _Pray_ increases the chance of striking a monster. It wears off after the next combat.

The advanced cleric spells are:

- _Serious cure_ heals you more than **cure wounds**.
- _Hold person_ has a chance to hold any human or goblin, allowing you to kill it. It is more likely to succeed than **charm**.
- _Dispel myth_ has a chance to dispel any mythical monster that isn't a dragon, ending the combat.

Specific details about each spell are in the game's manual. The spells that aren't listed here (and are listed with an asterisk in the game's manual) aren't implemented.

If you have them, I recommend casting **speed** and **protection from evil** upon entering the dungeon.

## Combat

When you encounter a monster, you have the following options:

- _Fight_ the monster. Upon selecting this option, the entire combat will be simulated instantaneously. In practice, you are almost guaranteed to lose a combat without spells, regardless of your level.
- _Run_ from the monster. This is only possible in corridors.
- _Cast a spell_ on the monster. This uses up one spell slot of the corresponding type. Exiting the dungeon restores all of your spell slots.

Monsters are grouped into the following categories:

- _Humans_.
- _Goblins_: kobolds, goblins, orcs, hobgoblins, gnolls, and ogres.
- _Animals_: giant rats, lizards, ants, weasels, scorpions, and hogs.
- _Undead_ monsters: skeletons, zombies, ghouls, wights, wraiths, and vampires.
- _Mythical_ monsters: stirges, harpies, gargoyles, Medusas, wyverns, and dragons.

Specific details about each monster are in the game's manual.

I used the following combat strategy, which is a modified version of [the one published by the CRPG addict](https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2019/01/revisiting-dungeon-1975.html):

- If the monster is at or below level 4, cast **sleep** if you have it.
- Otherwise, if the monster is a human or a goblin, cast **hold** if you have it.
- Otherwise, if the monster is a human or a goblin, cast **charm** if you have it.
- Otherwise, if the monster is mythical and not a dragon, cast **dispel myth** if you have it.
- Otherwise, if the monster is undead, cast **blastbolt** if you have it and have only one spell slot remaining.
- Otherwise, if the monster is undead, cast **magic missile** if you have it.
- Otherwise, cast **speed** if you have it and it isn't active, cast **cure wounds** if you have it and have taken damage, cast **protection from evil** if you have it and it isn't active, cast **pray** if you have it and it isn't active, then **fight**.

It is not possible to win against a significant portion of the possible monsters on a fresh character. I lost the majority of my playthroughs within about 20 seconds. It took me a few hours of research and less than an hour of total playtime to achieve my record run.
