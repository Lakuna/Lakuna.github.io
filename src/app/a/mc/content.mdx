# Minecraft Server

My Minecraft server runs 24/7 at _mc.lakuna.pw_.

**It is possible to connect with a vanilla client.**

The server uses [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) with [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium), [Elytra Trinket](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra_trinket),
and [squaremap](https://modrinth.com/plugin/squaremap).

The online map can be found [here](https://map.mc.lakuna.pw/).

The server will usually be running the latest version of Minecraft, but you can check the server's status [here](https://mcsrvstat.us/server/mc.lakuna.pw)
to make sure.

The server is hosted by [Revivenode](https://revivenode.com/).

The screenshot above was taken with [Complementary Shaders](https://www.complementary.dev/) and [Faithful](https://faithfulpack.net/) on Minecraft 1.20.1.

Although it is possible to connect to the server with a vanilla client, I recommend using Fabric with [JellySquid](https://jellysquid.me/)'s performance mods
(Lithium and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)). If you use shaders, [Iris](https://irisshaders.net/) is a great alternative to
[OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net/home) that works with Sodium.
