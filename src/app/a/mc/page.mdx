# Minecraft Server

My Minecraft server runs 24/7 at _mc.lakuna.pw_.

The server uses [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) with [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium). It is possible to connect with a vanilla client.

The server will usually be running the latest version of Minecraft, but you can check the server's status [here](https://mcsrvstat.us/server/mc.lakuna.pw) to make sure.

The server is hosted by [PebbleHost](https://pebblehost.com/).
