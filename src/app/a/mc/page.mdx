# Minecraft Server

My Minecraft server runs 24/7 at _mc.lakuna.pw_.

**It is possible to connect with a vanilla client.**

The server uses [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) with [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [squaremap](https://modrinth.com/plugin/squaremap).

The online map can be found [here](https://map.mc.lakuna.pw/).

The server will usually be running the latest version of Minecraft, but you can check the server's status [here](https://mcsrvstat.us/server/mc.lakuna.pw) to make sure.

The server is hosted by [Revivenode](https://revivenode.com/). {/* TODO: Move to PebbleHost? */}
