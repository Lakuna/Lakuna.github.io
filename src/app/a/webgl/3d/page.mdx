## Orthographic 3D

Using an orthographic projection matrix, primitives can be drawn in three dimensions without regard to perspective.

<Orthographic style={{ width: "100%" }} />

## Polygon Culling

In the example above, the back of the rotating shape shows through to the front in some places. One way to fix this is with _polygon culling_, which is where only front- or back-facing triangles are rendered. By default, a polygon is considered front-facing if its vertices are defined in a counter-clockwise orientation relative to the camera. Polygon culling can be enabled with [`enable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/enable). You can specify whether front- or back-facing polygons should be culled with [`cullFace`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/cullFace).

```js
gl.enable(gl.CULL_FACE);
gl.cullFace(gl.BACK);
```

Enabling polygon culling will make any triangles that are defined in the wrong orientation invisible. The orientation of a triangle can be reversed by swapping the order of the last two vertices.

## Depth Testing

In the example above, some polygons are showing through others that are in front of them. To fix this, enable _depth testing_, which tests the depth of fragments and only rasterizes them if they pass. The depth of fragments is computed from `gl_Position.z` and is stored in the _depth buffer_.

Depth testing can be enabled with `enable`.

```js
gl.enable(gl.DEPTH_TEST);
```

Like the color buffer, the depth buffer should be cleared at the beginning of every frame. A value can be set for fragments to be cleared to with [`clearDepth`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/clearDepth).

```js
gl.clearDepth(1);
gl.clear(gl.DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
```

The color and depth buffers can be cleared at the same time with a bitwise or operator.

```js
gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | gl.DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
```

<DepthTesting style={{ width: "100%" }} />

## Perspective

Since WebGL automatically divides `gl_Position.xyz` by `gl_Position.w`, it can be used to apply perspective. A _perspective projection_ is a projection that scales each vertex based on its distance from the camera.

<Perspective style={{ width: "100%" }} />

## Cameras

Rather than move a scene to fit in the view of the camera, it is more common to move the camera to view the scene. To do so, a matrix called a _camera matrix_ can be made to represent the transformation of the camera. This can be inverted to make a _view matrix_, which represents the transformation that would move the scene into the view of the camera. A projection matrix can be multiplied by a view matrix to make a _view projection matrix_, which can be used to both apply perspective and move the scene into the view of the camera. The product of a view projection matrix and a world matrix is called a _world view projection matrix_.

```glsl
gl_Position = u_view * u_proj * u_world * a_position;
```

<Cameras style={{ width: "100%" }} />
