# 3D

You may need to read the previous article about [the scene graph](/a/webgl/scene-graph) in order to understand this one.

## Orthographic

An *orthographic* projection is a way to draw 3D without regard to perspective.

import OrthoNoCull from "./OrthoNoCull";

<OrthoNoCull style={{ width: "100%" }} />

### Cull face

Notice that the back of the rotating shape in the example above shows through to the front in some places. One way to
fix this is to draw only front-facing triangles. By default, a triangle is considered front-facing if its vertices are
being rasterized in a counter-clockwise orientation relative to the camera. To do so, enable the `CULL_FACE` feature.

```js
gl.enable(gl.CULL_FACE);
```

You can also choose whether you want to cull polygons that are facing towards or away from the camera.

```js
gl.cullFace(gl.BACK);
```

In μGL, polygon culling is enabled via the `cullFace` accessor.

```js
gl.cullFace = FaceDirection.BACK;
```

Enabling `CULL_FACE` will make any triangles that are defined in the wrong orientation invisible.

import OrthoBadVertices from "./OrthoBadVertices";

<OrthoBadVertices style={{ width: "100%" }} />

The orientation of a triangle can be reversed by swapping the last two vertices.

import OrthoNoDepth from "./OrthoNoDepth";

<OrthoNoDepth style={{ width: "100%" }} />

### Depth test

Even when culling backwards-facing triangles, some triangles still show through others. This is because WebGL
doesn't remember the depth of a triangle unless the *depth buffer* is enabled.

```js
gl.enable(gl.DEPTH_TEST);
```

While the color buffer stores the RGBA values of each pixel, the depth buffer stores the depth of each pixel. The
third ("$z$") value of `gl_Position` is stored in the depth buffer. The depth buffer should be cleared before every
frame just like the color buffer.

```js
gl.clearColor(0, 0, 0, 0);
gl.clearDepth(1);
gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | gl.DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
```

μGL's `clearContext` function can be used to clear both the color and depth buffers in one line, and also enables
the depth buffer if necessary.

```js
clearContext(gl, new Color(0, 0, 0, 0), 1);
```

import Ortho from "./Ortho";

<Ortho style={{ width: "100%" }} />

## Perspective

*Perspective* is when things that are further away from the camera appear smaller. WebGL automatically divides the
value assigned to `gl_Position` by its fourth ("$w$") value. This is usefule for applying perspective because it
is equivalent to a scaling operation.

The example below shows two cubes (one on each side of the canvas). The cube on the left uses an orthographic
projection, and the cube on the right uses a perspective projection. Notice that the sides of the orthographic cube
are not visible despite being to the left of the camera.

import Perspective from "./Perspective";

<Perspective style={{ width: "100%" }} />

## Cameras

Rather than move a scene to fit in the frustum of a camera (as is the case in all of the examples above), it is more
common to move the camera to view the scene. To do so, a transformation matrix can be made to represent the camera,
called the *camera matrix*. The camera matrix can be inverted to make a *view matrix*. The *projection matrix*
(which is calculated according to different algorithms depending on the type of projection) can be multiplied by
the view matrix to make a *view projection matrix*. Objects in a scene can be "viewed" by a camera by multiplying their
world matrix by the view projection matrix to make a *world view projection matrix*.

import Cameras from "./Cameras";

<Cameras style={{ width: "100%" }} />
