# GPGPU

You may need to read [the article about framebuffers](/a/webgl/framebuffers) before this one.

General-purpose GPU (GPGPU) refers to doing work with the GPU other than rendering scenes. This can be useful when you need to perform lots of small, independent tasks, which GPUs are designed to excel at. GPGPU work can be performed both via textures and via buffers.

## GPGPU With Textures

Previous articles have already covered writing to textures and reading from textures via framebuffers. From that point, the only new thing that needs to be done to perform GPGPU work is to read data from a texture on the CPU. This can be achieved with [`readPixels`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/readPixels).
