# Uniforms

You may need to read [the article about attributes](/a/webgl/attributes) before this one.

Another way to pass data to the GPU is with *uniforms*, which variables that are uniform for each
vertex. They can be defined in both vertex and fragment shaders.

Uniforms are declared using the `uniform` keyword. For example:

```glsl
#version 300 es

precision highp float;

uniform vec4 u_color;

out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
	outColor = u_color;
}
```

In order to manipulate a uniform from JavaScript, the WebGL API must first be queried for its location.

```ts
const location: WebGLUniformLocation | null =
	gl.getUniformLocation(program, "u_color");
```

A uniform's value can be updated by calling the function that corresponds to the type of data that
it holds. For example:

```ts
gl.uniform4fv(location, [1, 0, 0, 1]);
```

import Uniforms from "./Uniforms.jsx";

<Uniforms style={{ width: "100%" }} />
