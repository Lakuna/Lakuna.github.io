# Cubemaps

You may need to read the articles about [lighting](/a/webgl/lighting) and [textures](/a/webgl/textures) before this one.

A _cubemap_ is a type of texture that consists of six faces, each referenced by their direction from the center of a cube. Cubemaps are sampled using normals that represent the direction from the origin to the desired texel (rather than texture coordinates). A cubemap can be sampled using a `samplerCube` variable.

```glsl
#version 300 es

precision mediump float;

in vec3 v_normal;

uniform samplerCube u_texture;

out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
	vec3 normal = normalize(v_normal);
	outColor = texture(u_texture, normal);
}
```

## Environment Maps

The most common thing that cubemaps are used for are _environment maps_, which represent the environment of a scene. Environment maps are a way to approximate reflections. If a fragment shader knows the position and normal of its fragment relative to the origin, it can use the `reflect` function to calculate a reflection.

```glsl
#version 300 es

precision mediump float;

in vec3 v_worldPos;
in vec3 v_normal;

uniform samplerCube u_texture;
uniform vec3 u_camPos;

out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
	vec3 normal = normalize(v_normal);
	vec3 camToSurfaceDir = normalize(v_worldPos - u_camPos);
	vec3 reflectDir = reflect(camToSurfaceDir, normal);
	outColor = texture(u_texture, reflectDir);
}
```

You can find the source of the example texture [here](https://polyhaven.com/a/leadenhall_market).

## Skyboxes

A _skybox_ is a cubemap that represents the background of a scene (often a sky). Skyboxes can be implemented by using the inverse of the view projection matrix to sample the skybox onto a plane that covers the entire rendering context.

The vertex shader should ensure that the skybox is always at the back of the depth buffer.

```glsl
#version 300 es

in vec4 a_position;

out vec4 v_position;

void main() {
	gl_Position = a_position;
	gl_Position.z = 1.0;

	v_position = a_position;
}
```

The skybox is treated as being infinitely far away from the camera, so calculations involving it should use a _view direction matrix_, which is a view matrix with the translation component removed.

A fragment shader can multiply a fragment's position by the inverse of a _view direction projection matrix_ (a product of a projection matrix a view direction matrix) to undo it. Then, it needs to manually divide the `xyz` vector by `w` to apply perspective. The result can be sampled from the environment map to make a skybox.

```glsl
#version 300 es

precision mediump float;

in vec4 v_position;

uniform samplerCube u_texture;
uniform mat4 u_inverseViewDirProjMat;

out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
	vec4 t = u_inverseViewDirProjMat * v_position;
	vec3 skyboxNormal = normalize(t.xyz / t.w);
	outColor = texture(u_texture, skyboxNormal);
}
```
