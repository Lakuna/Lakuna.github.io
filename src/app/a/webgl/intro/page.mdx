# Introduction to WebGL

This article assumes that you have an advanced understanding of JavaScript, but assumes nothing about your prior knowledge of computer graphics.

Computers represent visual information in discrete units called _pixels_.

Computers understand all shapes as collections of points, lines, and triangles. Collectively, these are referred to as _primitives_.

The process of computing the mapping from scene geometry (primitives) to pixels (actually fragments, more in the next article) is called _rasterization_. Compared to other rendering techniques (such as ray tracing), rasterization is extremely fast and therefore best suited for use in real-time applications such as video games.

_OpenGL_ is a specification for an API that can be used to render 3D scenes. _WebGL_ is a specification that is based on OpenGL but is designed to work in the browser. The WebGL 2.0 specification (based on OpenGL ES 3.00) can be found [here](https://registry.khronos.org/webgl/specs/latest/2.0/).

## The WebGL API

The _WebGL API_ allows developers to interface with WebGL via JavaScript. It can be accessed through the [`WebGL2RenderingContext`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL2RenderingContext) class, which can be instantiated with the [`HTMLCanvasElement.getContext`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/getContext) method.

```js
const canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");
const gl = canvas.getContext("webgl2");
```

Documentation for the WebGL API can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API).

It can be helpful to use a library such as [Î¼GL](https://ugl.lakuna.pw/) to make working with the WebGL API less tedious.
