# Framebuffers

You may need to read [the article about textures](/a/webgl/textures) before this one.

A framebuffer can be thought of as a collection of attachments, which are buffers with purposes.
They can be used to rendering to textures and _renderbuffers_, which are objects that contain images.

Renderbuffers differ from images in that they support more formats but can't be sampled. Renderbuffers
also support _multisampling_, which is a process for reducing _aliasing_, which is an effect that
reduces the quality of images that are under-sampled. This means that multisampling is a form of _antialiasing_.

A framebuffer can be created like this:

```js
const framebuffer = gl.createFramebuffer();
```

Like textures and buffers, framebuffers must be bound to a binding point in order to be accessed by
functions. Framebuffers have three binding points:

- `DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER`, which causes functions that modify attachments to target the attachments of this framebuffer.
- `READ_FRAMEBUFFER`, which causes functions that read from attachments to target the attachments of this framebuffer.
- `FRAMEBUFFER`, which causes functions that read from or modify attachments to target the attachments of this framebuffer.

There is a default framebuffer that is rasterized to the canvas. When no framebuffer is explicitly
attached to any of the framebuffer binding points, the default framebuffer is used.

Attachments can be added using the `framebufferTexture2D`, `framebufferRenderbuffer`, and `framebufferTextureLayer`
functions. **Every attachment in a framebuffer must have the same dimensions.** For example:

```js
gl.bindFramebuffer(gl.FRAMEBUFFER, framebuffer);
gl.framebufferTexture2D(
	gl.FRAMEBUFFER,
	gl.COLOR_ATTACHMENT0,
	gl.TEXTURE_2D,
	texture,
	0
);
```

In order to use the default framebuffer, simply attach `undefined` to the desired binding point.

## Rendering to Textures

Rather than writing to the default framebuffer and having that data rasterized to the rendering
context, it is possible to write to a custom framebuffer to store that data in textures or renderbuffers.

import RenderingToTextures from "./RenderingToTextures.tsx";

<RenderingToTextures style={{ width: "100%" }} />

Note that framebuffers don't have all of the attachments that the default one does by default. For
example, in order to use depth testing in a framebuffer, it needs to have a depth attachment.
