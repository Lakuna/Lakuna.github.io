# Varyings

You may need to read [the article about attributes](/a/webgl/attributes) before this one.

Another way to pass data to the GPU is with _varyings_, which are variables that vary between vertices.
They are outputs from vertex shaders and inputs to fragment shaders, so they are declared using the
`out` and `in` keywords, respectively.

A varying must be declared in both the vertex shader and the fragment shader. For example:

```glsl
#version 300 es

in vec4 a_position;
in vec4 a_color;

out vec4 v_color;

void main() {
	gl_Position = a_position;
	v_color = a_position;
}
```

```glsl
#version 300 es

precision highp float;

in vec4 v_color;

out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
	outColor = v_color;
}
```

The value of the varying for a fragment is interpolated between the values passed to that varying
from the vertices in the primitive that contains it.

import Varyings from "./Varyings.tsx";

<Varyings style={{ width: "100%" }} />
