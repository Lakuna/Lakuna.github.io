# Shaders

You may need to read [the introduction article](/a/webgl/introduction) before this one.

WebGL runs on the GPU, so it needs to be provided with code that the GPU is capable of understanding. The code is supplied in the form of functions called _shaders_. There are two types of shaders, each with a specific purpose:

- _Vertex shaders_ run once for each vertex. Their purpose is to compute the position of the vertex.
- _Fragment shaders_ run once for each _fragment_ (pixel). Their purpose is to compute the color of the fragment.

Whenever a primitive is rasterized, the vertex shader is first executed once for each vertex in the primitive. After all of the vertex positions have been computed, the fragment shader is then executed once for each fragment in the area that is bounded by those vertices.

Both types of shaders return `vec4` values, which are vectors that contain four floating-point values. In order, the four values are referred to as `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`.

- The return value of the vertex shader represents the position of the vertex in _clip space_, which is a coordinate system that represents the rendering context on the interval $[-1,1]$. Everything outside of clip space is _clipped_ (not rasterized). The negative boundaries for each direction are left, down, and near, respectively. The fourth value is used as a divisor for the first three.
- The return value of the fragment shader represents the color of the fragment in _color space_, which organizes the red, green, blue, and alpha values of the color on the interval $[0,1]$, respectively.

## GLSL

WebGL shaders are written in a strictly-typed language called _GLSL_. The specification for _GLSL ES 3.00_ (the version used by WebGL2) can be found [here](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/specs/es/3.0/GLSL_ES_Specification_3.00.pdf).

Every shader defines a function called `main` that is executed when the shader is executed. This method is responsible for setting the return value of the shader.

- For vertex shaders, the return value is set with a special variable called `gl_Position`.
- Fragment shaders can have many return values, so output variables must be defined using the `out` keyword.

The fragments returned by a fragment shader constitute a bitmap image that is stored in a portion of contiguous memory called a _framebuffer_. A framebuffer can have multiple regions that hold color data called _color buffers_. Each color buffer corresponds to an output variable in a fragment shader. The _draw buffer_ is the color buffer that contains the fragments that are rasterized to the rendering context.

In order to specify that a shader should use version ES 3.00 of GLSL, its first line must be `#version 300 es`. **If this is not the first line in a WebGL2 shader, it will not compile**.

A minimal WebGL2 vertex shader looks like this:

```glsl
#version 300 es

void main() {
	gl_Position = vec4(0, 0, 0, 1);
}
```

A minimal WebGL2 fragment shader looks like this:

```glsl
#version 300 es

precision highp float;

out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
	outColor = vec4(0, 0, 0, 1);
}
```

The line `precision highp float;` in the fragment shader sets the precision of floating-point values. It is not necessary in the vertex shader because the vertex shader has a default precision for floating-point values.

The WebGL API can be used to compile shaders. For example, the minimal vertex shader from above can be compiled like this:

```ts
const vertexShaderSource = `\
#version 300 es

void main() {
	gl_Position = vec4(0, 0, 0, 1);
}`;

const vertexShader: WebGLShader = gl.createShader(gl.VERTEX_SHADER);
gl.shaderSource(vertexShader, vertexShaderSource);
gl.compileShader(vertexShader);

const compileStatus: boolean = gl.getShaderParameter(
	vertexShader,
	gl.COMPILE_STATUS
);
if (!compileStatus) {
	const infoLog: string = gl.getShaderInfoLog(vertexShader);
	throw new Error(infoLog);
}
```

The process is nearly identical for compiling vertex shaders and fragment shaders, except that they should use the constant values `VERTEX_SHADER` and `FRAGMENT_SHADER`, respectively.

## Shader Programs

One vertex shader and one fragment shader can be linked together to create a _shader program_, which can be used to rasterize primitives. The process for creating a shader program with the WebGL API is very similar to the process for creating a shader. For example:

```ts
const program: WebGLProgram = gl.createProgram();
gl.attachShader(program, vertexShader);
gl.attachShader(program, fragmentShader);
gl.linkProgram(program);

const linkStatus: boolean = gl.getProgramParameter(program, gl.LINK_STATUS);
if (!linkStatus) {
	const infoLog: string = gl.getProgramInfoLog(program);
	throw new Error(infoLog);
}
```
