# Attributes

You may need to read [the article about program structure](/a/webgl/program-structure) before this one.

Since shaders run on the GPU, any data that they need to access must be passed to the GPU. One way
to do so is with _attributes_, which are a type of variable that reads data from arrays of binary
data called _buffers_ and are used as inputs to vertex shaders. They are used to pass vertex-specific
data to shader programs.

Since attributes are inputs to vertex shaders, they are declared using the `in` keyword. They cannot
be declared within fragment shaders. For example:

```glsl
#version 300 es

in vec4 a_position;

void main() {
	gl_Position = a_position;
}
```

In order to manipulate an attribute from JavaScript, the WebGL API must first be queried for its
_location_, which is a pointer to a variable in a shader program. For example:

```ts
const location: number = gl.getAttribLocation(program, "a_position");
```

## Buffers

In order to manipulate a buffer with the WebGL API, it first needs to be pointed at with a type of
pointer called a _binding point_. Each binding point has a specific purpose. For example, the _array
buffer_ binding point is used to specify a buffer that contains vertex attributes.

A buffer can be created and filled with data like this:

```ts
const buffer: WebGLBuffer = gl.createBuffer();

gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, buffer);

const data: BufferSource = new Float32Array([0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0.7, 0]);

gl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, data, gl.STATIC_DRAW);
```

Notice that `buffer` is not passed to `bufferData`. This is because it is first bound to `ARRAY_BUFFER`,
(the binding point used for buffers that contain vertex attributes), which is then passed in its stead.

`Float32Array` is a type of `BufferSource` that contains 32-bit floating-point values as binary data.
Although JavaScript is aware of the type of data, this context is lost when stored in the buffer.

The third argument passed to `bufferData` is a hint to WebGL about how the data will be used. For example,
`STATIC_DRAW` means that the data will be specified once and read many times. This hint is used for
optimization purposes.

## Vertex Array Objects

Since binary data requires extra context in order to be interpreted correctly, WebGL needs to be
passed some information when assigning a buffer to an attribute:

- The number of components that should be read for each vertex.
- The type of data in the buffer.
- Whether the data in the buffer should be normalized.
- The stride, which is the offset in bytes between the beginnings of consecutive vertex attributes.
- The offset in bytes of the first element that should be read.

A _vertex array object_ (VAO) is a collection of information that tells attributes which buffers they
should read data from and how they should do it.

A VAO can be thought of as representing a type of shape. For example, every cube has the same vertex
positions and can therefore use the same VAO.

In order to allow an attribute to accept data from buffers, it must be enabled. Once an attribute
is enabled, it can be told to read a certain buffer by a VAO. The following code creates a VAO, enables
an attribute, and passes the necessary information for the attribute to read from a buffer to the VAO.

```ts
const vao: WebGLVertexArrayObject = gl.createVertexArray();

gl.enableVertexAttribArray(location);

gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, buffer);

const size = 2;
const type: number = gl.FLOAT;
const normalized = false;
const stride = 0;
const offset = 0;
gl.vertexAttribPointer(location, size, type, normalized, stride, offset);
```

Notice that neither `buffer` nor `ARRAY_BUFFER` are passed to `vertexAttribPointer`. This is because
the buffer bound to `ARRAY_BUFFER` is automatically used, since `ARRAY_BUFFER` is the binding point
for buffers that contain vertex data.

Since `size` (the number of components that should be read for each vertex) is set to `2`, each vertex
will get its `x` and `y` values from the buffer, and its `z` and `w` values will be set to their default
values of `0` and `1`, respectively. Since the buffer contains six values that are read two at a time,
there are three vertices' worth of data stored in the buffer.

The `type` is set to `FLOAT` because the data in the buffer came from a `Float32Array`.

The `stride` being set to `0` tells WebGL that the data is _tightly-packed_, meaning that the number
of bytes from the start of one element to the next is the same as the byte size of the element.

## Rasterizing

The data stored in a VAO can be rasterized by setting the active shader program and VAO, then executing
one of a few rasterization functions. For example:

```ts
gl.useProgram(program);
gl.bindVertexArray(vao);

const primitiveType: number = gl.TRIANGLES;
const skippedVertexCount = 0;
const vertexCount = 3;
gl.drawArrays(primitiveType, skippedVertexCount, vertexCount);
```

import Attributes from "./Attributes.tsx";

<Attributes style={{ width: "100%" }} />

## Indices

WebGL allows vertex data to be reused by specifying indices in the _element array buffer_.

Imagine that you want to rasterize a rectangle (four vertices). Rectangles are not primitives, so
it must be rasterized using two triangles (six vertices). However, since two pairs of those six
vertices overlap, they can be defined using only four vertices if they are given indices.

Indices can be added to a VAO by binding a buffer to the `ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER` binding point and
filling it with unsigned integer data. The following example uses comments to describe how a
rectangle is being constructed using four vertices grouped into two triangles:

```ts
const buffer: WebGLBuffer = gl.createBuffer();
gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, buffer);
const data = new Float32Array([
	0,
	0.5, // Vertex 0 at (0, 0.5).
	0,
	0, // Vertex 1 at (0, 0).
	0.7,
	0, // Vertex 2 at (0.7, 0).
	0.7,
	0.5 // Vertex 3 at (0.7, 0.5).
]);
gl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, data, gl.STATIC_DRAW);

const vao: WebGLVertexArrayObject = gl.createVertexArray();
gl.enableVertexAttribArray(location);
gl.vertexAttribPointer(location, 2, gl.FLOAT, false, 0, 0);

const indexBuffer = gl.createBuffer();
gl.bindBuffer(gl.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, indexBuffer);
const indices = new Uint8Array([
	0,
	1,
	2, // Triangle 0 with vertices 0, 1, and 2.
	0,
	2,
	3 // Triangle 1 with vertices 0, 2, and 3.
]);
gl.bufferData(gl.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, indices, gl.STATIC_DRAW);
```

When rasterizing a VAO with indices, `drawElements` should be called instead of `drawArrays`. For example:

```ts
const primitive: number = gl.TRIANGLES;
const indexCount = 6;
const indexType: number = gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE;
const skippedIndexCount = 0;
gl.drawElements(primitive, indexCount, indexType, skippedIndexCount);
```

Note that the type of data stored in the element array buffer is never passed to the VAO, so it must
be passed to `drawElements`. This is set to `UNSIGNED_BYTE` because the data is from a `Uint8Array`.

<Indices style={{ width: "100%" }} />
