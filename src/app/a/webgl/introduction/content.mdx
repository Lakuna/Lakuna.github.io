# Introduction to WebGL

This article assumes that you have an advanced understanding of JavaScript, but assumes no prior knowledge about computer graphics.

Computers represent visual information in discrete units called _pixels_.

Computers understand all shapes as collections of points, lines, and triangles. Collectively, these are referred to as _primitives_.

Drawing one or more primitives with pixels is a process referred to as _rasterization_. Engines that are used to rasterize primitives are called _rasterization engines_. _WebGL_ is a rasterization engine that is designed to work in the browser. The specification for version 2 of WebGL (_WebGL2_) can be found [here](https://registry.khronos.org/webgl/specs/latest/2.0/).

WebGL2 is based on another rasterization engine called _OpenGL_. The specification for _OpenGL ES 3.0_ (the version that WebGL2 is based on) can be found [here](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/specs/es/3.0/es_spec_3.0.pdf).

## The WebGL API

The _WebGL API_ allows JavaScript to interface with WebGL. It can be accessed through the [`WebGLRenderingContext`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext) class ([`WebGL2RenderingContext`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL2RenderingContext) for WebGL2). Objects of either class can only be instantiated with the [`HTMLCanvasElement.getContext`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/getContext) method. For example:

```ts
const canvas: HTMLCanvasElement = document.querySelector("canvas");
const gl: WebGL2RenderingContext = canvas.getContext("webgl2");
```

Documentation for the WebGL API can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API).
