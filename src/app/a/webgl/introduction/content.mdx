# Introduction to WebGL

This article assumes that you have an advanced understanding of JavaScript, but assumes no prior
knowledge about computer graphics.

Computers represent visual information in discrete units called *pixels*.

Computers understand all shapes as collections of points, lines, and triangles. Collectively,
these are referred to as *primitives*.

Drawing one or more primitives with pixels is a process referred to as *rasterization*. Engines that
are used to rasterize primitives are called *rasterization engines*. *WebGL* is a rasterization engine
that is designed to work in the browser. The specification for version 2 of WebGL (*WebGL2*) can be
found [here](https://registry.khronos.org/webgl/specs/latest/2.0/).

WebGL2 is based on another rasterization engine called *OpenGL*. The specification for *OpenGL ES 3.0*
(the version that WebGL2 is based on) can be found [here](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/specs/es/3.0/es_spec_3.0.pdf).

## The WebGL API

The *WebGL API* allows JavaScript to interface with WebGL. It can be accessed through the `WebGLRenderingContext`
class. In order to use WebGL2, a `WebGL2RenderingContext` is required. Objects of either class can
only be instantiated with the `HTMLCanvasElement.getContext` method. For example:

```ts
const canvas: HTMLCanvasElement = document.querySelector("canvas");
const gl: WebGL2RenderingContext = canvas.getContext("webgl2");
```

Documentation for the WebGL API can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API).
