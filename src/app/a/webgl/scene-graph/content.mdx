# The Scene Graph

You may need to read [the article about transformation](/a/webgl/transformation) before this one.

A _scene graph_ is a general data structure that arranges the logical representation of a graphical scene. It is a collection of nodes in a tree structure, with each node having one parent and a non-negative number of children. Only the top node has no parent.

Each node's transformation matrix is multiplied by all of its ancestors' to generate its _world matrix_, which represents its actual position in a scene relative to the origin. The transformation matrix represents its position relative to its parent.

import SceneGraph from "./SceneGraph.tsx";

<SceneGraph style={{ width: "100%" }} />
