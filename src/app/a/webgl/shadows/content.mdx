## Shadow Maps

The most common way to rasterize shadows is with _shadow maps_, which are textures that contain depth data from the point of view of a light source. A shadow map can be created by rendering the scene to a framebuffer with a depth attachment from the point of view of the light source. The fragment's depth is stored in the first (`r`) channel of the depth texture.

Any surface that falls within the frustum of the projection but has a lower depth value than the shadow map at that position is in shadow. For example:

```glsl
#version 300 es

precision highp float;

in vec2 v_texcoord;
in vec4 v_projectedTexcoord;

uniform vec4 u_color;
uniform sampler2D u_texture;
uniform sampler2D u_projectedTexture;

out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
	vec3 projectedTexcoord = v_projectedTexcoord.xyz / v_projectedTexcoord.w;
	float depth = projectedTexcoord.z;

	bool inRange = projectedTexcoord.x >= 0.0
		&& projectedTexcoord.x <= 1.0
		&& projectedTexcoord.y >= 0.0
		&& projectedTexcoord.y <= 1.0;

	float projectedDepth = texture(u_projectedTexture, projectedTexcoord.xy).r;
	float shadowLight = inRange && projectedDepth <= depth ? 0.0 : 1.0;

	vec4 textureColor = texture(u_texture, v_texcoord) * u_color;
	outColor = vec4(textureColor.rgb * shadowLight, textureColor.a);
}
```

## Shadow Acne

The strange patterns in the example above are called _shadow acne_ and are a result of the limited resolution of the shadow map, causing surfaces to shade themselves. It can be mitigated by adding a bias to the calculated depth of each fragment. For example:

```glsl
float depth = projectedTexcoord.z + u_bias;
```

The bias required to remove shadow acne from a surface depends on the angle from the light source to that surface, so varying the bias value based on that angle can improve the appearance of the scene. For example:

```glsl
float bias = max(
	u_biasFactor * (1.0 - dot(v_normal, u_lightDirection)),
	u_biasMinimum);
```

Adding a bias can lead to an effect called _peter panning_ in which shadows appear to be slightly disjointed from their caster. This can be resolved by culling front faces when making the shadow map.
