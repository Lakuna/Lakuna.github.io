You may need to read the articles about [cubemaps](/a/webgl/cubemaps) and

The most common way to rasterize shadows is with *shadow maps*, which are textures that contain
depth data from the point of view of a light source. Any surface that falls within the frustum of
the projection but has a lower depth value than the shadow map at that position is in shadow.
