## Directional Lighting

*Directional lighting* (also called *diffuse lighting*) is light that comes uniformly from one direction.
If the direction that the light is traveling and the direction that a surface is facing are both known,
it is possible to determine the brightness of the light on that surface. This is equivalent to the cosine
of the angle between the directions, which is equivalent to the dot product of the directions.

The direction that a surface is facing is represented by a unit vector called a *normal*. Normals are
typically passed to the vertex shader with an attribute, then to the fragment shader with a varying. For example:

```glsl
#version 300 es

in vec4 a_position;
in vec3 a_normal;

uniform mat4 u_viewProjection;
uniform mat4 u_world;
uniform mat3 u_normal;

out vec3 v_normal;

void main() {
	gl_Position = u_viewProjection * u_world * a_position;
	v_normal = u_normal * a_normal;
}
```

Notice that the normals are multiplied by a matrix called `u_normal`. A *normal matrix* is the
inverse transpose of the rotation portion of a transformation matrix. The upper-left three-by-three
part of a transformation matrix is the part that stores rotation data, so the fourth row and column
can be ignored. Inverting and transposing this matrix causes the normals to remain correct even when
the shape is scaled. The normals are multiplied by the normal matrix but not the view projection matrix,
since the light source shouldn't move when the camera moves.

The brightness of a surface is equivalent to the cosine of the angle between that surface's normal
and the direction from that surface to the light source. The direction to the light source is the
opposite of the direction that the light is traveling. The cosine can be calculated by taking the
dot product of the angles. For example:

```glsl
#version 300 es

precision highp float;

in vec3 v_normal;

uniform vec3 u_reverseLightDirection;
uniform vec4 u_color;

out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
	vec3 normal = normalize(v_normal);

	float brightness = dot(normal, u_reverseLightDirection);

	outColor = u_color;
	outColor.rgb *= brightness;
}
```

Notice that since the normal is interpolated when being passed to the fragment shader, it has to be
normalized before it can be used.

## Colored Lighting

Color can be given to a light source by multiplying the brightness by that color. For example:

```glsl
#version 300 es

precision highp float;

in vec3 v_normal;

uniform vec3 u_reverseLightDirection;
uniform vec4 u_color;
uniform vec4 u_lightColor;

out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
	vec3 normal = normalize(v_normal);

	vec3 light = u_lightColor.rgb
		* dot(normal, u_reverseLightDirection);

	outColor = u_color;
	outColor.rgb *= light;
}
```

## Ambient Lighting

*Ambient lighting* is lighting that is applied equally to all surfaces regardless of normal.
It is used to set a minimum brighness so that nothing in the scene is too dark. For example:

```glsl
#version 300 es

precision highp float;

in vec3 v_normal;

uniform vec3 u_reverseLightDirection;
uniform vec4 u_color;
uniform float u_ambientLight;

out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
	vec3 normal = normalize(v_normal);

	float directionalLight = dot(normal, u_reverseLightDirection);

	outColor = u_color;
	outColor.rgb *= directionalLight + u_ambientLight;
}
```

## Point Lighting

*Point lighting* is when light extends in every direction from a point. To emulate it, first pass
the direction from the surface to the light source as a varying. For example:

```glsl
#version 300 es

in vec4 a_position;
in vec3 a_normal;

uniform mat4 u_viewProjection;
uniform mat4 u_world;
uniform mat3 u_normal;
uniform vec3 u_lightPosition;

out vec3 v_normal;
out vec3 v_directionToLight.

void main() {
	gl_Position = u_viewProjection * u_world * a_position;

	v_normal = u_normal * a_normal;

	vec3 surfacePosition = (u_world * a_position).xyz;
	v_directionToLight = u_lightPosition - surfacePosition;
}
```

The direction to the light can then be used in exactly the same way as with directional lighting.
Point lighting is almost identical to directional lighting, except that the light direction is
interpolated between fragments.

import PointLighting from "./PointLighting.jsx";

<PointLighting style={{ width: "100%" }} />

## Specular Lighting

*Specular lighting* is when light reflects off of a shiny surface.

Light reflects off of a surface at the same angle that it hits that surface, so specular lighting
should occur if the angle from the light to the surface is the same as the angle from the surface to
the camera. Both angles can be calculated by taking the dot product of their vectors, then they can
be added together and normalized to get the *half vector*, which is the vector that sits halfway
between them. The brightness of specular light can be determined based on how similar the half vector
is to the normal.

First, the direction from the surface to the light and from the surface to the camera must be passed
as varyings (using the same process as with point lighting). Then, the brightness of the specular
lighting can be calculated as the dot product between the half angle and the normal. The object can
be given a shininess value to change the specular lighting from a linear to an exponential falloff,
which makes it look more realistic. For example:

```glsl
#version 300 es

precision highp float;

in vec3 v_normal;
in vec3 v_directionToLight;
in vec3 v_directionToCamera;

uniform vec4 u_color;
uniform float u_shininess;

out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
	vec3 normal = normalize(v_normal);
	vec3 directionToLight = normalize(v_directionToLight);
	vec3 directionToCamera = normalize(v_directionToCamera);
	vec3 halfVector =
		normalize(directionToLight + directionToCamera);

	float pointBrightness = dot(normal, directionToLight);
	float specularBrightness = pointBrightness >= 0.0
		? pow(dot(normal, halfVector), u_shininess)
		: 0.0;

	outColor = u_color;
	outColor.rgb *= pointBrightness;
	outColor.rgb += specularBrightness;
}
```

## Spot Lighting

*Spot lighting* is the same as point lighting except that the light only extends in a cone. To
emulate spot lighting, the cone needs a direction and a *limit*, which is the angle from the
direction of the cone to its sides. If the dot product of the direction to the normal is above
the cosine of the limit (the *dot limit*), the surface is within the cone.

The cone can be given an outer limit and an inner limit between which the brightness values are
interpolated, which would give the spotlight a smooth edge. For example:

```glsl
#version 300 es

precision highp float;

in vec3 v_normal;
in vec3 v_directionToLight;

uniform vec4 u_color;
uniform vec3 u_reverseLightDirection;
uniform float u_innerLimit;
uniform float u_outerLimit;

out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
	vec3 normal = normalize(v_normal);
	vec3 directionToLight = normalize(v_directionToLight);

	float angularDistance =
		dot(directionToLight, u_reverseLightDirection);
	float brightness =
		smoothstep(u_outerLimit, u_innerLimit, angularDistance)
		* dot(normal, directionToLight);

	outColor = u_color;
	outColor.rgb *= brightness;
}
```
